# ASTRO-BIO-DYNAMICS
Space Biology Knowledge Engine Chatbot
üöÄ Astro-Bio Dynamics Terminal
The Astro-Bio Dynamics Terminal is a single-page, high-tech knowledge engine specializing in Space Biology. Built as a powerful chatbot, it uses the Google Gemini API with search grounding to provide up-to-date, cited answers regarding the effects of the space environment (microgravity, radiation, isolation) on living organisms.

‚ú® Key Features
Grounded Responses: Utilizes the Gemini API with Google Search grounding to ensure all answers are factual, current, and automatically include citations (attributions).

High-Tech Aesthetic: Features a custom, dark, neon console interface with a Inter font for a professional, futuristic look.

Streamlined Search UI: Combines the familiarity of a search engine layout with the visual flair of a data terminal.

Quick Query Tabs: Interactive buttons below the search bar to instantly initiate searches on popular space biology topics.

Responsive Design: Optimized for seamless use on both desktop and mobile devices.

Single-File Deployment: The entire application is contained within one self-sufficient index.html file, making deployment trivial.

üõ†Ô∏è Local Setup
Since this is a single, self-contained HTML file, no complex installation or server configuration is required to run it locally.

Open in Browser: Navigate to the file in your file explorer, right-click, and select "Open with" (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

The application will load instantly.

üíª Usage
Input Query: Type your question related to space biology (e.g., "What are the long-term effects of cosmic radiation on astronauts?") into the main search bar.

Use Tabs: Alternatively, click one of the neon Quick Query Tabs to populate the search bar with a common topic.

Review Results: The response will appear as a structured data card, complete with a detailed answer and a list of Attributions (citation sources) generated by the grounding API.
